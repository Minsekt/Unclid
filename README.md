# Unclid Probe

This is a Combination of [Euclid Probe](https://euclidprobe.github.io/) and [Unklicky](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky). 

I started with me messing up a PCB of the Euclid probe while desoldering a D2F thats been at the end of it's life.

Started to mess around with a printable alternative of the euclid PCB but ultimatively ended up with this because its so much better than a microswitch.

Currently using the BFP version of Unklick, with a 6x3 Magnet. will make it a little bigger so auto-z works fine too.
