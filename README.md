# Unclid Probe (replacement) (BETA)

This is a Replacement for the Euclid Probe. (only probe PCB)

This is only replacing the lower PCB, which means it doesnt matter if youre using a 24v or 5v euclid.

A Combination of [Euclid Probe](https://euclidprobe.github.io/) and [Unklicky](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky).

However design is heavily based on [SlideSwipe](https://github.com/chestwood96/SlideSwipe)

| Name | Pieces |
| ------ | ------ |
| Stock Euclid Magnets | 2 |
| M2x10MM | 2 |
| M3x8MM | 2 |
| 6x3MM Magnet | 2 |

Switch is NC. (design heavily based on Chestwood96's SlideSwipe design)

Works with the Original Euclid Dock without any modifications!
