# Unclid Probe (EUCLID PROBE replacement)

This is a direct replacement for the Euclid Probe.

This is only replacing the lower PCB, which means it doesnt matter if youre using a 24v or 5v euclid.

A Combination of [Euclid Probe](https://euclidprobe.github.io/) and [Unklicky](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky).

However design is heavily based on [SlideSwipe](https://github.com/chestwood96/SlideSwipe)

Bom
| Name | Pieces |
| ------ | ------ |
| Stock Euclid Magnets | 2 |
| M1.6 x 6MM | 2 |
| M2 x 10MM | 2 |
| 6x3MM Magnet | 1|
| 10x5x2MM Magnet | 1|

Switch is NC. (design heavily based on Chestwood96's SlideSwipe design)

Works with the Original Euclid Dock without any modifications!
